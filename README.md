# Project 1: Scrape data with `scrapy`

## Ideas of websites to scrape

- Books and reviews from [goodreads.com](https://www.goodreads.com/)
- Formula1 data?
- Sailing (with lat-lng):
    - America's cup?
    - Cape2Rio?
    - Olympics
- Olympics data?
- Power usage with grids?
- Crime statistics? (with addresses)
    - Not really web-scraping: https://www.westerncape.gov.za/general-publication/crime-statistics-20032004-20092010-20112012?toc_page=3
    - web-scraping, but painful and not much data: https://www.crimestatssa.com/index.php#!/statistics/
- Spotify: Needs JavaScript
- [Bandcamp](https://bandcamp.com/)
- Wikipedia
- Crypto?
- Recipes from various websites
- Kickstarter: Not very nicely formatted website
- [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/foryou): Might have to use selenium to get around JS loading
